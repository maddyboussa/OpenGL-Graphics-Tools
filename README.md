# Polygon-Creation-Tool
Polygon Creation Tool utilizes OpenGL and the graphics pipeline to create a C++ application that allows users to draw and render polygons onto the screen.

To create this tool, I implemented a PolyObject class that stores vertex data and includes draw functionality based on said vertices. It also required in-depth understanding of OpenGL's callback function, and how vertex data is handled by both the CPU and GPU.
